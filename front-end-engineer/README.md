## 🏓 Choose a Challenge
We've listed two different challenges below for you. The details for each challenge are listed inside the [challenges](./challenges/) directory.

#### 1. 💬 [Real Time Chat App](./challenges/real-time-chat-app.md)
#### 2. 👩🏼 [Users Profile](./challenges/personal-profile-viewer.md)


#### All Challenges Should Include
- 📱 Mobile-responsive UI to interact with APIs
- 👾 Code that can be deployed and run on a server(if necessary)

### Challenge Rules & Guidelines
- Please do not use fake Github accounts, we want to check your contributions history since we do a lot in open source.
- Remember to commit changes after every task.
- Even though we are open to high level questions, **we are not answering any detailed questions about this challenge.** We've made this detailed enough for you to show us your strengths.
- All your styles should be written using SCSS.
- Feel free to use boilerplates or CLI tools according to your preference (we would use [`npx create-nuxt-app`][create-nuxt-app] or Vue CLI's `vue create`. You can use whatever you're comfortable with, as long as the challenge is completed to the specification)

### Evaluation Criteria
- Asking good questions is a good quality. We will not penalize you for asking questions. In an actual work environment, we prefer that engineers spend 30 minutes talking a problem over with someone than spend an entire day building the wrong thing.
- We're looking for signs you understand concepts such as errors, events, promises, and reactivity, and how those concepts are implemented in Javascript.
- We're also looking for signs that you understand good styling practices.
- We like code that is clean, readable and easily testable. Your ability to demonstrate this is a big plus.
- We're looking for an understanding of accessibility and good performance metrics in your submission.
- Please comment your code.

### Opening a PR

- Go to Github and [open a new pull request][open-pull-request] from your branch to master.
- Fill out the [pull request template][pull-request-template] and assign [codebender828][codebender828] as a reviewer.
- I'll add my comments, deploy it, test it, and approve or request changes based on my experience.
